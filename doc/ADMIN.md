## Module SyncYunoHost

By activating the SyncYunoHost module in the config panel, you must choose a Group from the YunoHost directory. Dolibarr will then activate the Members module. 
* You'll first need to create a membership fee in the Members module, with a price and duration. 
* By adding a membership, you add a user with his personal e-mail address, which will create a Yunohost user. 
* When his subscription is up to date, he is automatically added to the Group selected in the LDAP directory. 
* When the user's subscription is no longer up to date, he/she will be removed from the chosen Group.
* By deleting it from Dolibarr, the Yunohost user is deleted (for security reasons, it is not possible to delete a user from the admins group).
